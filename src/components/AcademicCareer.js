                        I achieved a <strong>Bachelor of Science</strong> degree with a major in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and a minor in

                        I was sought out by one of my statistics professors to be a teacher's assistant/marker for a senior-level
                        statistics course, STAT 350: Sampling Theory and Applications, during my final year of schooling.

                        My academic strengths are primarily in databases, machine learning, and statistics; however, I am always
                        trying to learn new technologies to stay updated and ahead in everything programming.
